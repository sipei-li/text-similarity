',\n",

       "       '\"I think you\\'re going to continue to see higher rates until Powell shoots something across the bow. He either gets rates going higher or he slows it down,\" said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance.',\n",
       "       'The bulls are finding comfort in sound fundamentals and sticking to a familiar script: So long as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell takes on the mantle of gradual rate hikes, the \"Goldilocks\" growth story stays intact and earnings remain robust.',\n",
       "       'The Fed also provides new economic and interest rate forecasts after that meeting, and Powell will also speak publicly to the press after the meeting. ',\n",
       "       'Powell appeared to side with the \"hawks\" again in the summer of 2015 when he argued two interest rate rises might be needed, but the meltdown in the Chinese stock market that year meant he later backtracked and the Fed eventually raised rates only once that year in December.',\n",
       "       'Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said little about the sharp fall in Wall Street stocks this month, besides offering the platitude at his swearing-in ceremony last week that \"we will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability.\"',\n",
